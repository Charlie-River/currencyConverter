# currencyConverter
This is the first Java application that I created! (Outside of my studies). I wanted a small application to add to my portfolio that displays a few of the skills that I learned so far during my time. The creation of this was much different to any I had done during my studies with different controller and application pages so they may not be perfect ðŸ¤«

Some of the features of this application code include: 
  -  2D array to calculate the changes between currencies
  -  JavaFX to give the application a GUI
  -  Validation to ensure that users cannot enter other values

## What I Would Change!
Though this project has been thought of as "complete", there are still a few things I might go and change.
For example: 

 + One thing I need to look into changing for this program is whether I could create one method for the toggle buttons that would change the value of targetCurrency based on the data passed into it rather than having their own separate set and get methods that are then given to each button separately.

**BUT** The project works! And at the time of making it that's all I was focused on ðŸ˜Ž
